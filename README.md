# Omadora

Turn a fresh Fedora installation into a fully-configured, beautiful, and modern web development system based on Hyprland by running a single command. That's the one-line pitch for Omadora (adapted from Omadora for Fedora). No need to write bespoke configs for every essential tool just to get started or to be up on all the latest command-line tools. Omadora is an opinionated take on what Linux can be at its best.

Omadora is a Fedora adaptation of [Basecamp's Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy).
